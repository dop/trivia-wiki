Patterns : list, list*, cons, constant, variable, wildcard (_)

Any symbols are considered as variable, except constant symbols (namely,
 =t=, =nil= and keywords) and those named as =_= (checked by symbol name).
 These are identical to the corresponding patterns in Optima.

=ematch0= signals an error when the input did not match any
patterns. =lambda-match0= and =lambda-ematch0= expands to =lambda= which
takes an argument and pass it to =match0= and =ematch0=, respectively.
