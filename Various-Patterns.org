Trivia maintains a full compatibility with Optima. If you are already familier with Optima, there is no need to understand anything new, other than the additional patterns introduced in Trivia.
As the baseline, [[https://github.com/guicho271828/trivia/wiki/Match-and-Variants][this page]] describe the syntax of macro =match= and its variants. 
In the following sections, I briefly summarize what kind of patterns are available in these matcher macros.


+ [[./Type-Based-Destructuring-Patterns][Type-Based Destructuring Patterns]] (In addition to the Optima's pattern, Trivia has *soft-match* variants and *specialized* variants of vector patterns)
+ [[./Logic-Based-Patterns][Logic Based Patterns]]
+ [[./Special-Patterns][Special Patterns]] (=place= pattern, =bind= pattern and =access= pattern)
