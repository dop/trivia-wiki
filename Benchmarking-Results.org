* Fibonacci

Computes a large Fibonacci number. I didnt apply the memoization technique: it is a quite basic implementation.

* Gomoku

Matches /winning pattern/ of 5x5 Gomoku table game against a list of randomly generated fields. 100000 fields are generated and fixed, then supplied to each matcher.

* Stringmatch

Collected all words in Lorem Ipsum @ wikipedia, then created a function that returns true if the corpus contains the given word. The input vector is a list of words of the original sentence in /De finibus bonorum et malorum/.

* Results
