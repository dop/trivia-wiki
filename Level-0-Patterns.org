This page describes the set of patterns that is allowed to be used to implement the subsequent levels of  pattern matchers. Thus, it only matterns for the implementers of trivia itself.

Available Patterns are restricted to: list, list*, cons, constant, variable, wildcard (_).

Any symbols are considered as variables, except for constant symbols (namely,
 =t=, =nil= and keywords) and those named as =_= (checked by symbol name).
 These are identical to the corresponding patterns in Optima.

=ematch0= signals an error when the input did not match any
patterns. =lambda-match0= and =lambda-ematch0= expands to =lambda= which
takes an argument and pass it to =match0= and =ematch0=, respectively.
