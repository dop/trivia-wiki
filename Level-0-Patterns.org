Level0 pattern matchers provide a very limited set of patterns.
These are used for implementing level 1 / 2 patterns.
As this is a part of a compiler, the implementation of level 0 matcher is aimed at cleanness and not speed.

Available Patterns are restricted to: =list, list*, cons=, constant, variable, wildcard (_).

Any symbols are considered as variables, except for constant symbols (namely,
 =t=, =nil= and keywords) and those named as =_= (checked by the symbol's name, they don't have to be exported).
 These are identical to the corresponding patterns in Optima.

+ match0 : returns the body of the first matching pattern. Returns NIL when all patterns fail.
+ ematch0 : Same, but signals an error when all patterns fail.
+ =lambda-match0= and =lambda-ematch0= : expands to =lambda= which takes one argument and pass it to =match0= and =ematch0=, respectively.
