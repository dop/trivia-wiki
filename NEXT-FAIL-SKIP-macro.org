Trivia has Optima's FAIL macro with the same functionality, but this symbol is loaded optionally.
This is because the symbol FAIL is so common in many other libraries, notably in fiveam and other testing libraries. Therefore, we export FAIL in a separate package =trivia.fail=, and you should =:use= it manually.

We also provide other aliases. You can use NEXT with =trivia.next= package, and SKIP by =trivia.skip=.
NEXT also conflicts with symbol =iterate:next=.
Fortunately, to our knowledge, there is no famous library exporting SKIP.
